Bootstrap
---------

    $ npm install

Development
-----------
A development server is provided to serve static assets.

    $ script/server

A watch script is useful to recompile existing jade templates if they change.

    $ script/watch

But for anything else, like changing a base or include, or adding a file, you'll need to manually recompile (or restart watch).

    $ script/compile
